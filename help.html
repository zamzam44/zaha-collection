      <p><strong>1. Project Goal:</strong>  
      The goal of this project is to build a fashion website using HTML and CSS. The website must showcase a clothing collection called “Zaha Collection.” It should demonstrate your knowledge of structure, styling, forms, tables, navigation, and layout.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Number of Pages:</strong>  
      The website must have exactly five HTML pages: Home (index.html), Gallery (gallery.html), Booking (booking.html), Help (help.html), and About (about.html). Each page must be clearly labeled and linked from the navigation bar.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Page Content:</strong>  
      Every page should have real content. The index page should welcome users and introduce the website. The gallery page must include at least 3 product images and one product table. The booking page must contain a complete HTML form with inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, a dropdown, and a textarea.</p>

      <p><strong>4. External CSS:</strong>  
      All pages must link to a shared external CSS file called style.css. The CSS must control the layout, fonts, colors, hover effects, spacing, and optionally use Flexbox or Grid for layout. Internal or inline CSS should not be used.</p>

      <p><strong>5. HTML Tags Required:</strong>  
      Your website should include headings (h1–h3), paragraphs, lists, tables, images, links, and forms. Images should include the alt attribute. Navigation links must work between all pages without errors.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Navigation Bar:</strong>  
      All pages must have a consistent navigation bar that links to the five main sections of the site. The navbar should appear at the top of every page and match in style and function across all pages.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Submission:</strong>  
      When finished, all project files (HTML, CSS, images) must be saved in a single folder. The folder should be zipped and submitted via your teacher or uploaded to GitHub if required. Double-check all files and links before submission.</p>
